<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Park Access and
Health: My Journey with Spatial Data Analysis</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hello, my name is Matt Ketterer and I am recent Master of
Applied Statistics graduate from Pennsylvania State University. In my research
project I utilized spatial data to estimate the health benefits of public park
access. While I am not an ArcGIS user, I found through my research that spatial
data can lead to new feature engineered variables. This blog post is about my
journey using spatial data to predict health by combining it and national
health survey data.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Trust for Public Land (tpl.org) is dedicated to
increasing and tracking public park access in the US. Its mission of
“connecting everyone to the outdoors” is an easy to get behind concept and
would likely be beneficial to people’s health. Still, I wondered if I would be
able to model this relationship to show if access improves health outcomes and
by how much. For instance, it would be valuable to know from a healthcare cost
savings standpoint the extent to which park access could reduce health care
visits by encouraging outdoor activities and physical activity. I wanted to see
if I could model this using the US metropolitan and micropolitan areas from the
CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS) data. This is a subset
from a massive telephone health survey that focuses on town and city areas
where most of the population resides and is predicted to grow in the future. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ParkServe database is a great tool that I came across.
While its main function is to serve as an inventory for parks, it has census
demographics and some health related filters embedded in the website. I used it
to compare access percentages across the surveyed health responses from the
CDC.</p>

Gathering and Exploratory Analysis</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since the public park data is through a web portal, I had to
manually retrieve the values for each of the 130 of the CDC’s surveyed
metropolitan and micropolitan areas from the ParkServe Database GIS portal. This
part of data gathering was sometimes laborious, but once I had all the values
for each city/region, I could merge it with the approximately 220,000
individual responses to their corresponding city in the CDC dataset using the R
programming language. The hardest part was when some of the regions didn’t
match completely, due to slight changes in the core based statistical area
(CBSA) definitions between 2015 and 2024. In the case where a county was
missing between two CBSA definitions, I had to manually combine counties to
come up with a park access estimate using weighted population averages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Building a
Statistical Model and Results</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To estimate the effect of public park access, I chose a response
variable to the survey question of “How many days in the last 30 days was your
physical health not good?”. This is a discrete count variable between 0 and 30
that could be modelled with a count distribution, in this case a zero-inflated
negative binomial model. The advantage of using a count variable in a
statistical model, as opposed to a categorical one, such as asking if your
health is “Good”, “Fair”, or “Poor”, is that there is more information, thus
giving more statistical power, since there are 31 ‘bins’ of responses and they
are ordered. The model was also adjusted for many factors that would affect
health, this was to give some validation to the park access variable. These
predictor variables used in the model were park access, age, race, sex, education,
and smoking. The region itself was also included in the model to see if there
were any differences in unhealthy days responses but was not statistically
different from any other city. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Predicted number of unhealthy days by sex, race, and park
access tier</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After adjusting for other factors known to be a cause of
poor health, park access has a small but significant effect. Inhabitants living
in a city with a better park system have a lower predicted number of sick days
than those that live in the lowest tier. This would imply that increased access
helps drive park usage and physical activity such as walking and being in
nature, improving health. Also, when we are talking about whole populations,
small positive benefits add up to cost savings. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Final
Thoughts</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am excited and inspired to pursue more spatial and
non-spatial data together in my future research. I hope to work directly with
ArcGIS and R in the future to explore the possibilities. In the meantime, I’m
going to take my kid to the park. If you ever get a chance to explore the Puget
Sound and Bremerton, Washington, take in the beautiful scenery, maybe at a
public park. It is good for your health!</p>
